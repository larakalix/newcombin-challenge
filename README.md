# My React.js Project

Welcome to my React.js project! This README will guide you through the steps required to run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

-   Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org) if it's not already installed.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
- git clone https://github.com/larakalix/newcombin-challenge.git
```

2. Install the dependencies using

```
- npm i, pnpm i or yarn
```

2. Navigate to the project's directory, and install the dependencies:

```
- cd client-app, then npm i, pnpm i or yarn
```

3. Install the root project dependencies using npm or Yarn:

```
- npm i, pnpm i or yarn
```

## Running the Project

To run the project, execute the following command:

```

This command will start the development server and compile your API and React.js project. You can access the running client project by opening a web browser and visiting the url from the console, example: `http://localhost:5173` or `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
